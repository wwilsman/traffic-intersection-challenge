# Code Challenges

We want to see code you've written. Some people don't have open source
or freely available code they can share, so we have some short code
challenges you can do. You can pick from `INTERSECTION.md` or
`SPELL_CHECK.md`.

Use whatever language and tech stack you're most comfortable with.

Just like in real life, you can use the internet to help you remember
some syntax or figure out a library. Unlike real life, you *should
not* use someone else's solution for the project. Use good
judgement. Googling how to read in a file is fine. Googling "how does
a spell-checker work" to understand an algorithm is fine. Copying and
pasting a spell-checker you've found online is not fine.

The goal isn't to finish the assignment (though we won't complain if
you do!). The goal is to see how you approach a problem. Can you
decide on and implement an algorithm? What data structures do you use?
How do you organize your code? What parts of the problem seem most
important to solve first?

Please contact us if anything in the instructions is confusing. We've
tried to leave space for creativity and problem-solving, but we also
don't want you becoming frustrated or stuck.

Good luck!
