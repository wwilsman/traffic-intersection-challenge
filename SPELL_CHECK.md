# Make a Spell Checker!

Write a program that checks spelling. The input to the program is a
dictionary file containing a list of valid English words and a file
containing the text to be checked.  You can use the `dictionary.txt`
file included here as your dictionary.

The program should run on the command line like so:

```bash
my-cool-spellchecker dictionary.txt file-to-check.txt
# output here
```

## The Features

Your program should support the following features (time permitting):

* The program outputs a list of incorrectly spelled words.
* For each misspelled word, the program outputs a list of suggested
  words.
* The program includes the line and column number of the misspelled
  word
* The program prints the misspelled word along with some surrounding
  context.
* The program handles proper nouns (person or place names, for
  example) correctly.

## Instructions For Submission

Please email us a link to a GitHub repository containing your
code. Include a `README.md` file with notes for us. If your code runs,
please include instructions for running it.
